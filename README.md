# deep-learning-courseworks

This repository includes the projects i did in my course of deep learning in my postgraduate degree. I used pytorch to develop the different deep learning algorithms.
The first coursework is about Convolutional Neural Networks and  the second is about Generative AI (VAE and GAN). In both courseworks i conducted a thorough hyperparameter tuning and experimented with different architectures to find the one that yields the best results for my problems.
