# deep-learning-courseworks

This repository includes the projects i did in my course of deep learning in my postgraduate degree. I used pytorch to develop the different deep learning algorithms.
The first coursework is about Convolutional Neural Networks and  the second is about Generative AI (VAE and GAN).
